<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>
	We sell a wide variety of quality items including action figures, miniatures and books. 
	We specialise in Transformers and Warhammer, but also sell many other science fiction and fantasy related items.
</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>
	Caliburn Entertainment is a small web-based retailer located in North Wales, owned and operated by Ian Whitby.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
	This website first started as an Amazon Store called Caliburn Books where we sold mostly science fiction and fantasy books. 
	As we started to sell more items, we branched out into other areas that interested us including Transformers and Warhammer. 
	It was at this time that we rebranded ourselves as Caliburn Entertainment, to better illustrate that we are not only a book specialist.  
	Due to the high fees charged by Amazon we moved to eBay, where we have scored a <%= link_to "100% positive feedback rating", "http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&userid=caliburnentertainment11&ftab=AllFeedback" %>. 
	We still maintain an eBay shop selling mostly the same items as we list here. 
	We decided to develop this website to showcase our products and provide a better, more user friendly experience for our customers. 
	We also hope to offer more competitive prices than our eBay shop as we do not have to pay the high eBay fees when selling through this website.
